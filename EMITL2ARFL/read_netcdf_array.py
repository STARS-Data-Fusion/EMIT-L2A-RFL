    Read a variable array from a specified group or the root in a NetCDF file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path to the NetCDF file to read from.
    group : Optional[str], default None
        Name of the group within the NetCDF file containing the variable. If None, reads from the root of the NetCDF data structure (global scope).
    variable : str
        Name of the variable to read from the group.
    window : Optional[rasterio.windows.Window], default None
        If provided, must be a rasterio Window object specifying the subset (window) to read.
        The window must have attributes row_off, col_off, height, and width.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The requested array, or the specified subset if window is provided.

    Raises
    ------
    KeyError
        If the group or variable does not exist in the NetCDF file.
    AttributeError
        If the window object does not have the required attributes.
